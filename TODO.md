# Widget Enhancement Plan

## Information Gathered:
- The `KenyaPremierLeagueWidgets.jsx` component displays live scores, fixtures, and standings for the FKF Premier League.
- The component loads an external script for widget functionality and is structured in a grid layout.
- The `TODO_NEW.md` outlines the phases of a ticket purchasing system, with a focus on testing and polishing the UI.

## Plan:
1. **Enhance Responsiveness:**
   - Ensure the widget layout adapts to different screen sizes.
   - Use CSS media queries to adjust grid layout and font sizes.

2. **Integrate with Ticket Purchasing System:**
   - Consider adding a "Buy Tickets" button next to each fixture in the widget.
   - Implement functionality to link the button to the ticket purchasing system.

3. **Testing:**
   - Verify that the widget displays correctly on various devices.
   - Test the integration with the ticket purchasing system to ensure smooth user experience.

## Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `src/components/KenyaPremierLeagueWidgets.jsx` (for widget enhancements)
- `css/styles.css` (for responsive design adjustments)

## Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the planned enhancements.
- Test the widget for responsiveness and integration with the ticket purchasing system.
